## Four Menus to Gander
- Command Menu: A basic menu which could house commands for your game (e.g center camera, show log, etc)
- Settings Menu: A menu showcasing commands, bools, & option menu items for various things like Menu Padding, Menu BG Color, Opening a Debug Menu
- Debug Menu: This menu shows the pages off and attempts to break the formating of the menu. You can nest menus hiding behind conditions like a `debug` boolean.
- Inventory Menu: An example of a potential menu which updates when it opens
