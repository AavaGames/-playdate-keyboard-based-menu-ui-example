# Keyboard Based Menu

A playdate keyboard based menu.

## Nested Menus
Multiple menus can be opened at a time, allowing for options in one menu to open a sub-menu to another. Only the latest one is updated and drawn. When a menu overflows with options it automatically creates another sub-menu as a "page".
